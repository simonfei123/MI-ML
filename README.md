# MI-ML
Exploratory Machine Learning Algorithms for the NTX Motor Imagery BCI Project

Ignore the deep learning part(aka EEGNet) and comment out those "import tensorflow" lines, it's not worth the time it takes to set it up. I assume that XDawn+Tangent Space with Random Forest is currently working.


### To-do:
  - add Linear Discriminant Analysis to XDawn+Tangent Space(replacing Random Forest)
  - Try more algorithms
